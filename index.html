    <p>Introduction
The objective of this chapter is to explain<br> the importance of analysis of algorithms, their notations,
relationships and solving as many problems as possible.<br> We first concentrate on understanding the
importance of analysis and then slowly move<br> towards analyzing the algorithms with different notations and
finally, the problems. After completion of<br> this chapter you should be able to find the complexity of any
given algorithm (especially recursive functions).<br>

Just to understand better,<br> let us consider the problem of preparing an omelet. For preparing omelet, general
steps which we follow are:<br>
<br>) Get the frying pan.<br>
2) Get the oil.<br>
a. Do w<br>e have oil?<br>
i. If y<br>es, put it in the pan.
ii. If <br>no, do we want to buy oil?
<br>. If y<br>es, then go out and buy.
2. If n<br>o, we can terminate.
3) Turn<br> on the stove, etc..
What we<br> are doing is, for a given problem (preparing an omelet), giving step by step procedure for solving
it. F<br>ormal definition of an algorithm can be given as:
An algorithm is the step-by-step instructions to a given problem.
<br>One important note to remember while writing the algorithms is: we do not have to prove each step of the
<br>algorithm.
